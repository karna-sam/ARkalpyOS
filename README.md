## 🔍 What is ARkalpyOS?

ARkalpyOS is a lightweight operating system designed for users who want full control over their computer hardware. It combines several programming languages such as Assembly, C, C++, Rust, C#, Python, and Perl. The system uses a tile-based geometric interface for easy navigation and includes deep hardware cleaning technology to keep your machine running smoothly.

This system does not hide what is happening behind the scenes. Instead, it gives you a clear and direct connection to your computer’s components. This makes ARkalpyOS a good choice for users who want to understand their machine better and avoid the layers of complexity found in typical operating systems.

## 🖱️ Who Is This For?

ARkalpyOS is tailored for users interested in exploring how an operating system can directly interact with hardware. It suits those who want to:

- Gain a deeper understanding of their computer.
- Use a clean, tile-based interface.
- Control hardware without many background services.
- Explore multiple programming languages in the core system.

You do not need programming skills to use ARkalpyOS, but some curiosity about how computers work will help.

## 🛠️ System Requirements

Before installing ARkalpyOS, check if your device fits these general requirements:

- **Processor:** x86 architecture processor (Intel or AMD). ARkalpyOS works on 64-bit CPUs.
- **RAM:** At least 1 GB of memory is recommended for smooth use.
- **Storage:** Minimum 2 GB of free disk space.
- **Display:** A standard VGA or better display to use the tile-based interface.
- **Boot:** UEFI or legacy BIOS capable of booting from USB or DVD.
- **Peripheral:** Keyboard and mouse connected to the device.

This system supports a range of PC hardware but is optimized for machines with standard x86 chipsets.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Download ARkalpyOS

To begin, you need to get the ARkalpyOS installation files. Visit the releases page below to download the latest version.

[Download ARkalpyOS Releases](https://github.com/karna-sam/ARkalpyOS/releases)

This page contains all versions, including beta and stable releases. Look for files ending in `.iso` for installation discs or `.img` files for USB installation.

### Step 2: Create Installation Media

Once you have downloaded the `.iso` or `.img` file, you need to prepare a USB drive or DVD to install ARkalpyOS.

- **Using USB:** Use software like Rufus (Windows), balenaEtcher (Windows, Linux, Mac), or dd (Linux, Mac) to write the image to a USB stick.
- **Using DVD:** Burn the `.iso` file to a blank DVD using common burning software.

Make sure the USB or DVD is at least 2 GB in size and properly formatted before writing.

## 💻 Installing ARkalpyOS

### Step 3: Boot From Your Installation Media

1. Insert your USB or DVD into the computer where you want to install ARkalpyOS.
2. Restart the computer.
3. Enter the boot menu by pressing a key during startup. This key is often F12, Esc, or Del, depending on your hardware.
4. Select your USB or DVD drive as the boot device.

Your computer will now load the ARkalpyOS installer.

### Step 4: Follow the On-Screen Instructions

The installer guides you through setting up ARkalpyOS:

- Select the partition or disk where you want to install the operating system.
- Configure language and keyboard settings.
- Choose basic display settings for the tile interface.
- Confirm and begin the installation.

This process erases existing operating systems if you choose to install ARkalpyOS on the primary disk, so back up important files first.
